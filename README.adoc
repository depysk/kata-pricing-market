= Kata Pricing Market


The domain problem is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.

* Some things in supermarkets have simple prices:
** A can of beans costs 0.65. Two cans of beans costs 1.30.
** 1 ounce of tomatoes costs 0.20. 1 pound costs 3.2 (1 pound = 16 ounces).

* Other things have more complex prices. They can have discount applied:
** One can of beer costs 0.80. Three for 2 (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
** Get off 30% on the second product
** Get back 50 from 1000 purchase

The exercise is to experiment with a model that is flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes.


Evaluated items (mainly, but not only) will be:

* The structuring and modeling of the project
* TDD
* The relevance of the java 8 techniques used
